# Propositional Argument Validity

Due to taking a logic class, I have come across propositional logic. I learned how propositional arguments work using the book [Intermediate Logic by Canon Logic Series](https://www.amazon.com/Intermediate-Logic-Student-Canon/dp/1591281660). 

The main module used is called **[Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)**. It can be installed onto your computer using the command:
```
pip install sympy
```


## About

There are fives types of symbols in propositional logic that are important to know in this program.

```
& -- and
| -- or
>> -- hypothetical statement (p implies q ; if p then q)
=== -- biconditional (logical equivalence)
~ -- negation
```
